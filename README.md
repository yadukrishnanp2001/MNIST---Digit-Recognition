# MNIST---Digit-Recognition
Developed a digit recognition model using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture includes a sequential neural network with ReLU activation. Trained on MNIST (60,000 grayscale digits), the model achieved 98% accuracy in 5 epochs. Demonstrates proficiency in neural network training for digit recognition tasks.
