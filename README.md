# MNIST-Digit-Recognition

This project presents a deep learning model for digit recognition using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture includes a sequential neural network with input and output layers, plus two hidden layers using ReLU activation. Trained on MNIST, comprising 60,000 grayscale digit images, the model reached 98% accuracy on validation after 5 epochs. With TensorFlow and Keras, this project showcases expertise in neural network training, ideal for exploring digit recognition.
